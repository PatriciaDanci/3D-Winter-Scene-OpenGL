OpenGL 3D Scene with Advanced Graphics Effects
This project is a real-time 3D scene built using OpenGL, featuring lighting effects, shadows, animations, and environmental effects. The scene includes multiple 3D models, interactive camera navigation, and dynamic effects like fog, rain, and water waves.

Features
✅ Realistic Lighting:

Directional and point lights with attenuation
Shadow mapping for dynamic shadows
✅ Dynamic Environment:

Skybox with day & night modes
Animated objects (e.g., trees swaying, teeter movement)
Water with wave displacement
✅ Special Effects:

Fog for atmospheric depth
Rain simulation with falling raindrops
Smoke particles for added realism
✅ User Interaction:

Camera navigation with keyboard & mouse
Render mode toggles (solid, wireframe, point mode)
Dynamic lighting adjustments (toggle directional & point lights)
Automated scene tour
Technologies Used
OpenGL 4.1
GLFW & GLEW for window and input management
GLM for mathematical operations
Custom shaders (vertex, fragment, depth mapping)
Controls
WASD / R, F: Move camera
Mouse: Rotate camera
1, 2, 3: Toggle render mode (solid, wireframe, points)
L, P, N: Toggle different lights
O: Enable/disable fog
9: Toggle rain

Setup & Run

Future Improvements
🚀 Adding volumetric lighting
🌊 More complex water reflections
🌨️ Improved weather simulation
